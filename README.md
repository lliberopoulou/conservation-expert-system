A expert system for the conservation of archaeological iron


This project was the MSc Thesis for a Computing Science cource at Birkbeck College, London and was presented at the 1999 AI*IA “Intelligenza Artificiale per i Beni Culturali” Workshop that was held at the University of Bologna. The domain is the conservation of small wrought iron objects found in land excavations. Since this happens to be one of the first expert systems for archaeological conservation I though someone might benefit from my experience if I publish the whole thing on the web.

The entire project (research, programming and write-up) took about three months. The rules where extracted mainly from the relevant literature and a few interviews with the conservation departments of the Museum of London, the British Museum and English Heritage.


How to run the Program

The executable of CLIPS 6.0 for windows is included with the expert system (CLIPS386.EXE).  You can get more information about the CLIPS interpreter at this address.

To run the program, simply follow the User guide in page no.17 of MScProject.doc. Although you might not be thrilled by the idea of a computing science project report I think is very important that you read the entire thing before you try to run the program.
