A expert system for the conservation of archaeological iron

Introduction
This project was the MSc Thesis for a Computing Science cource at Birkbeck College, London and was presented at the 1999 AI*IA “Intelligenza Artificiale per i Beni Culturali” Workshop that was held at the University of Bologna. The domain is the conservation of small wrought iron objects found in land excavations. Since this happens to be one of the first expert systems for archaeological conservation I though someone might benefit from my experience if I publish the whole thing on the web.
