Air abrasion- compressed air

Air abrasion is a scaled down version of 
sand-blasters which eject a stream of grit-like
particles propelled by pneumatic pressure. 
It is the most suitable way of mechanically
cleaning mainly fragile artefacts. Because of 
the variety of pressures and grits that 
can be applied, it is much more controlled than 
scalpel and safer than other types of mechanical 
cleaning like electric drills, air-hammers, scribes 
and etchers.The drawback of this method is that it 
requires special equipment and it is more time consuming. 
Extremely fragile objects can be cleaned with plain 
compressed air without any grit particles. This is a
 technique is very slow but in some cases it is the 
only way to clean very brittle layers of oxidation, 
it can also be used for the final stages of the
cleaning of objects with decorative designs.
