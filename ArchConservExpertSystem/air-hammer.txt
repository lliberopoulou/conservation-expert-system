Air-hammer

These pneumatic tools operate with a reciprocal 
motion of a conical stylus, that cycles up to 40,000 
motions per minute. The force applied by the stylus,
and the number of cycles per minute can be adjusted
to the needs of each particular task.When working with 
hard encrustation matrix, air-hammers can reduce cleaning 
time to a fraction of that accomplished by other methods.
The hand held stylus can also be fitted with different shaped 
chisels which have different cutting characteristics. Air-hammers 
are not suitable for fagile objects, they eare to powerful and can 
cause serious damage. They should also never be used for the 
cleaning ofcorossion products because thy move too fast 
and can damage tarces archaeological evidence such as organic 
materials.
