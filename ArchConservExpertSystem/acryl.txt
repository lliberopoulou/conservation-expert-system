Acrylic resin

These are synthetic polymers of acrylic acid usually dissolved 
in acetone or some alcohol (usually ethanol). Resistant against
oxidation and hydrolysis, they are completely transparent, have
great mechanical strength and are fully reversible.
They can be applied both as consolidants and adhesives, the only 
difference being the concentration of the solvent 

Consolidant: from 2-98 to 15-85 acrylic-solvent concentrations. 
They can be applied with a conventional brush or a small 
low-pressure airbrush. The object is then left to dry for a few
hours. The application is repeated if the object still shows signs 
of instability. 

Adhesive: from 20-80 to 40-60 acrylic-solvent concentrations 
A small quantity of adhesive is added to the edges of 
the broken pieces to be attached. The pieces are then 
held together, usually with the help of some adhesive tape, 
until the adhesive dries.
