Desiccated storage: 

Iron objects are stored in perforated polythene bags 
in airtight polythene boxes together with dried silica 
gel. Silica gel should be packed in 500 gram bags,and 
a relative humidity indicator strip should be include 
in each box to accurately monitor any changes.Ordinary 
self indicating silica gel changes from bleu to pink at 
about 30-35% RH, which is to high for safe storage.It is 
recommended to use approximately the same weight of silica 
gel in each box, as there is iron. Freshly excavated iron 
contains 10% water by weight and the absorption isotherm of 
silica gel indicates that at 15% RH the gel had absorbed 10% 
of its dry weight in water. If freshly excavated objects are 
placed in a sealed contained, together with their weight in 
silica, gel when the equilibrium is reached the RH of the 
container will not exceed 15%.Boxes should be opened as 
infrequently as possible and for only a short time. The 
indicator strips should be checked frequently.If the RH is 
approaching the danger level the silica gel should be 
changed and regenerated.
