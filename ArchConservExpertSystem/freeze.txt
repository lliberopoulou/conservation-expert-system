Freezing

Application: The object is placed inside a 
freezer (-10 to -20C).It is better not to put 
the objects directly form  temperatures above 
15C in and frozen environment. They must go 
through a process of gradual lowering of there 
temperature until it reaches the desired level.

This technique is very efficient, most of the 
chemical reaction that cause the object to corrode 
stop in temperatures bellow zero. But it is not 
suitable for fragile objects because water trapped 
inside there pores mite expand and cause serious 
mechanical damage. This technique also requires a 
freezer which consumes lots of energy and must be have 
backup power supply to ensure there will be no long periods 
of unacceptable temperatures.
