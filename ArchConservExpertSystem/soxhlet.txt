Soxhlet  

The method takes its name from the Soxhlet device 
used for its application.

Application: The object is placed in the devise, which 
gets filed with nitrogen gas, over boiling water. The 
steam rises to a condenser above the object and falls back 
as water soaking the object and carrying the chloride ions 
intothe boiling water container below. The chloride ions 
remain in the container, with only the water revaporising 
to repeat the cycle. 

This method is much more efficient than the immersion in 
distilled water and doesn't have the dangers of aqueous boiling. 
It is ideal for very fragile objects and objects with organic 
materials attached The only serious problem with it is that it 
requires special materialsand equipment like the soxhlet device 
and nitrogen gas. Most conservation laboratories would not be able 
to apply this technique.
