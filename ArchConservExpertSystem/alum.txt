Air abrasion-aluminium oxide

Air abrasion is a scaled down version of sand-blasters 
which eject a stream of grit-like particles propelled 
by pneumatic pressure. It is the most suitable way of 
mechanically cleaning mainly fragile artefacts. Because 
of the variety of pressures and grits that can be applied, 
it is much more controlled than scalpel and safer than 
the other types of mechanical cleaning electric drills, 
air-hammers, scribes and etchers.The drawback of this 
method it requires special equipment and it is more time 
consuming.A strong grit like aluminium oxide can easily 
work its way trough encrustation layers without damaging 
the object and considerably accelerate the cleaning process. 
It is usually better to stop less than half of a millimetre 
from the actual surface before switching to a softer grit.
