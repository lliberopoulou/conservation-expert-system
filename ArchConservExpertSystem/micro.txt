Microcrystalin wax

Synthetic waxes with high melting point (well above 100°C). 
They are relatively hard and are the least permeable to 
water vapour of any of the commonly used consolidants. 
But they can become brittle and yellow with time. They are used 
for the not only as consolidants but also as water reppelants.  
The object is immersed in the melted wax and is left 
for several hours to absorb the material. It is then removed from 
the vat and the excess wax is left to flow off the surface. 
The object then is left to dry for a few hours in room temperature
