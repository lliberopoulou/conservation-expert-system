Hydrogen Plasma Reduction

Application: the iron artifacts are placed in a quartz discharge tube and 
hydrogen gas is released under a low pressure. The hydrogen gas is then 
ionized into plasma by the introduction of high frequency radio waves. The 
thermal reaction converts chloride into volatile compounds. The temperature 
of the hydrogen gas can range from 400°C to 100°C.

Hydrogen plasma reduction is very efficient and requires much sorter application 
times than any other desalination technique. In lower temperatures it is also suitable 
for fragile objects. Its major disadvantage is that it requires a high-frequency 
coupled plasma installation, which can be found only in large research centers. 
Because it usually involves high temperatures it is not suitable for very fragile objects 
or objects with organic materials attached to them.
