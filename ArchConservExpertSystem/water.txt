Distiled water

Application: The object is immersed distilled or 
deionised water usually in a polythene container. 
The water should be regularly checked and renewed
when a considerable amount of chloride ions are in solution.

This method is very slow and not very effective. Even small 
objects can require several months and in some cases years 
to be fully desalinated. It is suitable though for very fragile 
objects and objects with organic materials attached. In any other 
case this technique should probably be avoided unless there is 
specific reason to apply it (shortage of other materials etc)
