Aqueous boiling

Application: The object is immersed in several baths of boiling 
distilled water. The process is repeated until there is no 
detectable chloride ions on the object

Much more efficient than other methods like distilled water and 
the Soxhlet and faster that alkaline sulfide. The continuous 
immersion in boiling distilled water can cause problems to 
fragile objects.
