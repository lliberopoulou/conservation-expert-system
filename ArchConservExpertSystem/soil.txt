Storage in soil

This storage treatment tries to emulate the environment 
of where the object was found to maintain the conditions 
that brought it to astate of passivation.The object is placed 
in a (usually) polythene box which already has a layer of soil 
on the bottom. If the object is very small then one or two more 
objects can be placed next to it. The object(s) is then slowly 
covered with the excavation soil. Objects can remain in soil  
storage for several years unattended without ever having any 
problems. This technique is suatable for very fragile objects and 
objects with organic materials. Because it requires great amounts 
of space it is better to use alternative methods unless its necessary.
