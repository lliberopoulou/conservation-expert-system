Cold Alkaline Sulphide

Application: The object is immersed in an aqueous solution 
of 0.5N NaOH/0.5N Na2SO3 in room temperature a sealed 
container. The water isolates the object from the 
atmosphere and the NaOH/Na2SO3 rapidly absorbs the free 
oxygen present in the water and prevents it from reacting 
with the metal. The container must be kept sealed at all 
times because otherwise NaOH/Na2SO3 will absorb oxygen from 
the atmosphere and lose its inhibiting qualities very fast.

This technique is ideal for very for very fragile objects but 
should be avoided for objects with organic materials or other 
metal attached to them. Also the containers with the solution 
are quite heavy and difficult to handle
