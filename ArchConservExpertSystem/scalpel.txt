Scalpel

Application: This is simply cleaning the object with various 
types of scalpels and scalpel blades(usually scalpel base 
no.3 or no.4). The entire process must be contoled with 
the help of a stereomicroscope.

This is  very controlled technique that requires patience and 
experience. It can be harmful for very fragile objects because 
some times it is difficult to control the pressure applied to 
the blade.
