Alkaline sulphite 

Solution:0.5N NaOH/0.5N Na2SO3 in deionised water

Application:The object is immersed the aqueous 
alkaline sulphide solution in sealed containers. 
The application time can be up to three months and 
the temperature is constantly kept to 60°C. The chloride 
content of the objects should be tested regularly


It is very effective and easy to use method it is ideal
for objects in good condition with still surviving metal.
The NaOH/Na2SO3 soloution is highly alkaline and sould 
never be used on objects with trases of organic materials 
and other metals. Frigile objects can also suffer mechanical
damage because of the evolution of nytrogen gas during the 
treatment process.
