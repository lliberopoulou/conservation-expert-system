Lithium hydroxide. 

 Solutions: 0.05M lithium hydroxide in ethanol or I.M.S. ethanol can also 
be used but it is much more toxic. 

 Application: the object(s) are immersed for 40-30 days and the solution
is changed every 15 days. No more than 175 gr of iron can be treated per 
litre of solution. 

 This method is not as fast and efficient as the aqueous alkaline sulphite 
method but because it is non-aqueous it can be applied directly on desiccated
objects. It is also much more gentle than the plasma and alkaline sulphite 
treatments which makes suitable for fragile objects. Because it is applied in 
an alcohol solution certain health and safety measures are required and the high 
PH forbids its application on objects with other metals or organic materials
attached.

 Lithium hydroxide ionophoresis

 Solution: 0.05M lithium hydroxide in I.M.S. with a 150mA current applied. 
This improves considerably the efficiency of the treatment.
