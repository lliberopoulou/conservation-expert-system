Air abrasion-sodium bicarbonate

Air abrasion is a scaled down version of sand-blasters 
which eject a stream of grit-likeparticles propelled 
by pneumaticpressure. It is the most suitable way of 
mechanically cleaning mainly fragile artefacts. 
Because of the variety of pressures and grits that 
can be applied, it is much more controlled than scalpel 
and safer than the other types of mechanical cleaning 
electricdrills,air-hammers, scribes and  etchers.The 
drawback of this method it requires special equipment 
and it is more time consuming. A medium strength 
grit like sodium bicarbonate can be used to remove the 
oxidation product on non-frigile objects and work its way 
trough encrustation layers of fagile objects without damaging 
the object and considerably accelerate the cleaning process. 
If the object is extremely fragile it might be better to stop 
less than half of a millimetre from the actual surface before 
switching to a softer grit.
